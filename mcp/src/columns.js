/**
 * How a row of candidates becomes a row of columns.
 *
 * Shared verbatim with Kelvin's picker (Kelvin/mcp/src/columns.js) because both render the
 * same thing: Kirchhoff's sourcing tools return Kelvin's own candidates, so a second column
 * heuristic here would disagree with the one that produced the data. ABT #663 asks
 * websharedcomponents for the component both should import; until then this file is a
 * deliberate, marked copy rather than a fork — change it there, copy it here.
 *
 * Extracted from picker.js so it can be tested without a host bridge: the widget module
 * connects to the MCP Apps host at import, so anything left inside it can only be checked by
 * rendering the real GUI. The bug this file exists to prevent was exactly that — the ranked
 * views silently derived one column, and nobody noticed until someone rendered them.
